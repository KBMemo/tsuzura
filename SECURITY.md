# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not report suspected vulnerabilities in a public issue, discussion, or pull request.

For public releases, use GitHub's **Report a vulnerability** action in this repository's
Security tab. This opens a private vulnerability report visible only to repository
maintainers.

GitHub Private Vulnerability Reporting is available only for public repositories.
Maintainers must enable it immediately after changing repository visibility to public and
before announcing the repository.

Include the affected version or commit, reproduction steps, expected and actual behavior,
impact, and any suggested mitigation. Do not include production credentials, API tokens,
internal secrets, signed URLs, media files, or personal data in the report.

We aim to acknowledge valid reports within five business days and will coordinate a fix
and disclosure timeline privately with the reporter.

## Supported versions

Security fixes are made on `main`. Deployments should track the latest compatible commit
from that branch until versioned releases are established.
